# PlanIt — Recruiting One‑Pager (PM)

Elevator pitch
PlanIt uses AI to convert Gmail and Google Calendar into a prioritized, time‑aware daily plan that helps knowledge workers spend less time planning and more time shipping.

Top-line selling points
- Automates email-to-task extraction so users don't manually triage requests.
- Generates a daily timeline that fits tasks around meetings with estimated durations and buffers.
- Two-way Google Calendar sync keeps suggested tasks and events aligned.
- Privacy-first: tokens encrypted at rest; users control access.

Suggested screenshots (placeholders)
1. Inbox → Tasks: “Actionable items auto-extracted from emails.”
2. Daily Timeline: “AI schedules tasks around meetings with estimated durations.”
3. Explainability: “Short reasons why the AI prioritized each task.”

Key metrics to surface (replace placeholders with real data)

- Daily active planners (DAU): x users/day (placeholder)
- Task completion within suggested window: % (placeholder)

Top product challenges & interview talking points
